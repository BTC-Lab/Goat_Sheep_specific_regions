# Kraken2 was used to identify the best taxonomy for the fastq reads 
# 1000 random forward and 1000 reverse reads were selected from each sample
# 20 Goat samples and 20 Sheep samples.
# Sheep sample IDs: 083 to 092 and 103 to 112.
# Goat sample IDs: 073 to 82 and 093 to 102.
# The reads were matched with the whole NCBI nt database used "k2_nt_20230502" in Kraken2
# command details:
# kraken2 --quick --memory-mapping --db "/kraken2/k2_nt_20230502" --threads 4 --minimum-base-quality 10 --report-minimizer-data --use-names --classified-out "${sam}_#_classified.fastq" --unclassified-out "${sam}_#_unclassified.fastq" --report ${sam}_1Kread.txt --output "${sam}.kraken" --paired $file1 $file2
